Provides classes for implementing Support Vector Machine. 
It extends an abstract <code>Model</code> class.<br>

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<ul>
<li>Building a Model : Creates an independant model for each training SampleSet.
    SVM saves the models including support vectors and its alphas.
<li>Testing Models : Applies a testing SampleSet to every built models, and 
    votes the majority of results.
<li>Kernel Functions: A Polynomial and Radio Basis kernel functions were implemented.
<li>SVM_ParamFrame: Extends ParamFrame so that a user test different parameters.
<li>Default parameters are set. These defaults are decided after some testing with
'adult.arff' file and 3-fold cross validation. With another data file and N-folds,
the parameters should be adjusted by a user using SVM_ParamFrame.
</ul>
