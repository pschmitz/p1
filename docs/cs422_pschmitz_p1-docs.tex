        \subsubsection{Preprocessing}
        First, we will be replacing the missing values from a given data set.
        This will be carried out for the numeric values by replacing each of
        the missing values by the mean attribute value of the class of which
        the sample with missing value belongs.  For the categorical values,
        the mode value, most common value, will be used in each class.

        Entropy-based discretization will be implemented.  %Gor termination
                                %criterion pick any of the choices discussed
                                %in the lecture/book. Look at the data and see
                                %if you would think the results of
                                %discretization makes sense. You may change
                                %your termination criterion based on
                                %that. Make sure you explain this in your
                                %design document.
